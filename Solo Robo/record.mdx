# Record
Record datasets for training while teleoperating the follower. Requires both arms calibrated.

```bash
solo robo --type lerobot --record
```

### Interactive flow
- Reuse saved Recording settings or enter new ones.
- Confirm `robot_type`, `leader_port`, `follower_port`, and IDs, then set up cameras.
- Choose whether to push to HuggingFace Hub; if yes, you will be prompted to authenticate.
- Enter dataset repository name; if it already exists, choose whether to resume or rename.
- Enter task description, episode duration, and number of episodes.
- Recording starts and follows LeRobot's standard UI/controls.

### Tips/Notes
- Use `local/<name>` or a bare `<name>` to keep datasets local; pushing to Hub is optional.
- Controls during recording:
  - Right Arrow (→): early stop/reset and move to next
  - Left Arrow (←): cancel current episode and re-record
  - Escape (ESC): stop session, encode videos, and upload (if enabled)
- If ports change mid-session, the tool can detect new ports and retry once.
