You just recorded a LeRobot dataset with your robot. Maybe you also downloaded a dataset from the HuggingFace hub. With phospho, you can:

- repair corrupted datasets
- merge two datasets into one
- split a dataset into multiple datasets (e.g. training/validation/test sets)
- delete episodes from a dataset

## Prerequisites 

You need to install the phosphobot software on your computer. If you haven't done it yet, follow the [installation guide](/installation).

<InstallCode/>


For any of this operations, go to the dashboard and click on the `Browse Datasets` tab. Then move to the `lerobot_v2.1` folder.

You will see all your local datasets. To download a dataset from the HuggingFace hub, click on the `Add from hub` button. It will be downloaded and added to your local datasets.

## Repair a dataset

Select a dataset and click on the `Repair Selected Dataset` button. This will check that your dataset is valid and fix common LeRobot issues.

## Merge two datasets

Select two datasets and click on the `Merge Selected Datasets` button. This will merge the two datasets into a single dataset.
For now, you can only merge two local datasets at a time. If you need to merge more, you can do it recursively.

## Split a dataset

Select a dataset and click on the `Split Selected Dataset` button. This will split the dataset into two datasets.

## Delete a dataset

Select a dataset and click on the `Delete Selected Dataset` button. This will delete the dataset from your local datasets.

## Upload the dataset back to HuggingFace

Click the 3 dots on the right of the dataset and select `Push to Hugging Face Hub`. This will upload the dataset to your HuggingFace account.

## Visualize your dataset

Once your dataset is uploaded to HuggingFace, you can view it using the [LeRobot Dataset Visualizer](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lerobot/visualize_dataset). This will also check that your dataset is valid.

<Note>
  The dataset visualizer only works with the `AVC1` video codec. If you used
  another codec, you may see black screens in the video preview. Preview
  directly the videos files in a video player by opening your recording locally:
  `~/phosphobot/recordings/lerobot_v2/DATASET_NAME/video`.

Looking good? You're ready to train your AI model!
