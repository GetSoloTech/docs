# Calibration

Calibrate the leader and/or follower arm(s) after motor IDs are set.

```bash
# Calibrate both
solo robo --type lerobot --calibrate both

# Calibrate only leader
solo robo --type lerobot --calibrate leader

# Calibrate only follower
solo robo --type lerobot --calibrate follower
```

### Interactive flow
- Optionally reuse saved `robot_type` and ports or re-detect them.
- Choose or confirm `leader_id` and `follower_id` (stored for later reuse).
- For each arm selected, LeRobot's calibration is launched and you follow on-screen instructions.

### Tips/Notes
- Calibrate in a safe, clear workspace; follow the on-screen instructions carefully.
- If either arm fails to calibrate, you can rerun calibration for that arm only.
- Once both arms are calibrated, you're ready for Teleop and Recording.
