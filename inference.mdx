# Inference

Run a trained policy on the follower arm. Requires the follower to be calibrated. Teleoperation override is optional if the leader is calibrated and available.

```bash
solo robo --type lerobot --inference
```

### Interactive flow
- Reuse saved Inference settings or enter new ones.
- Validates calibrated follower; optionally enables Teleop override if leader is calibrated.
- Prompts to authenticate with HuggingFace (required to download remote models).
- Enter `policy_path` (HuggingFace model ID or local path), task description, and duration.
- Set up cameras (optional) and start inference.

### Tips/Notes
- If Teleop override is enabled, moving the leader arm temporarily overrides the policy.
- Same keyboard controls apply as in recording (→/←/ESC) for session control.
- If ports change, the tool can detect new ports and retry once.

## Cameras and ports

- **Ports**: Auto-detection works on Windows and Unix. If `pyserial` is missing, it is installed automatically. If the arm was already connected, you'll be guided to unplug/replug to identify the correct port.
- **Cameras**: Both OpenCV and RealSense cameras are supported. RealSense requires `pyrealsense2`. You can map each camera to a viewing angle and pick which ones to display during Teleop/Record/Inference.

## Troubleshooting

- **Connection failed / wrong port**: The tool will attempt to re-detect ports and retry once. If it still fails, unplug/replug each arm and re-run the mode.
- **Dataset already exists**: You will be prompted to resume or rename. Resuming continues appending episodes to the existing dataset.
- **HuggingFace authentication required**: Needed for downloading trained policies (Inference) and optionally for pushing datasets/models (Record/Train).
- **Windows symlink warnings**: Symlink warnings are suppressed for HF Hub downloads by the tool when needed.
- **No cameras detected**: You can proceed without cameras; functionality remains available.
