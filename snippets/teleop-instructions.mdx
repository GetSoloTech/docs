<Info>The phospho teleoperation app works with a [Meta Quest](https://www.meta.com/fr/quest/quest-3/?srsltid=AfmBOorMLUmJKFQr35ssCi1DDqSNgpHk0sLHqo_tHG8kgclCYbMToAPa). Compatible models: Pro, 2, 3, 3s.</Info>

1. In the Meta Quest, open the phospho teleop application. Wait a moment, then you should see a row displaying **phosphobot** or your computer name. Click the **Connect** button using the `Trigger Button`.

<Note>Make sure you're connected to the same WiFi as the phosphobot server or the control module</Note>  

<Info>If you don't see the server, check the IP address and port of the server in the phosphobot dashboard and enter it manually.</Info>
