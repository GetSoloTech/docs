# Teleoperation

Teleoperate the follower arm using the leader arm. Requires both arms calibrated.

```bash
solo robo --type lerobot --teleop
```

### Interactive flow
- If saved Teleop settings exist, choose to reuse or enter new ones.
- Confirm or detect `leader_port` and `follower_port`, confirm `robot_type`.
- Optionally set up cameras (OpenCV/RealSense), assign viewing angles, and select which cameras to display.
- Optionally choose/confirm `leader_id` and `follower_id`.
- Teleoperation starts; move the leader arm to control the follower.

### Tips/Notes
- If a connection error occurs, the tool can auto-detect new ports and retry once.
- Camera setup is optional; if no cameras are found or selected, Teleop will still work.
- Press Ctrl+C to stop Teleop at any time.
