# Train

Train a policy on recorded data.

```bash
solo robo --type lerobot --train
```

### Interactive flow
- Reuse saved Training settings or enter new ones.
- Provide `dataset_repo_id` (local or Hub dataset ID).
- Select policy type: SmolVLA, ACT, PI0, TDMPC, or Diffusion Policy.
- Set training steps and batch size.
- Choose output directory; if it exists, pick: resume, overwrite, or new directory.
- Choose whether to push the trained model to HuggingFace Hub (prompts for auth and repo name).
- Optionally enable Weights & Biases logging (prompts to login and set project).
- Training starts using LeRobot's training pipeline.

### Tips/Notes
- Some policies can start from a pretrained checkpoint; SmolVLA defaults to `lerobot/smolvla_base` if not provided.
- Video backend auto-falls back to PyAV if TorchCodec is unavailable.
- Checkpoints are saved regularly; you can resume later if needed.
- Press Ctrl+C to stop early; partial checkpoints may be saved.
