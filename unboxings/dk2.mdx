## 1. Attach the SO-100 arms

Find a table and fix each SO-100 robot arm using the table clamps in the kit (see image below). 

<Warning>Make sure the arm is securely fastened and won't move. Clear away any clutter that could get in the way of the arm's movement.</Warning>

## 2. Install the wrist cameras

For safe transport, the wrist cameras are not installed on the robot arms. You don't need screws or special tools to install them, just pop them in the holes on the robot arms.

Please refer to the video below to see how to install the wrist cameras.
